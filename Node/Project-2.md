For my Project-2 I expanded on server.js file by adding OS information, model information and directory information.

To run this file you have to open it in VS Code. Make sure that you have the ./public/index.html file open in the same folder. Run node in your terminal and then run the file by typing node server.js
Then go to a web browser and search for loaclhost:3000/ or localhost:3000/sysinfo

The result will look this:
