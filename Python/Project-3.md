I tried making a number guessing game! It has a very basic code.

In the game you have to guess numbers from 1-99 and it will let you know if the number is too high or too low than the hidden number. If you guess it right then it will tell you that it is right.

To run this file you have be in python and enter (python .\project-3.py) this command and you will be able to play the game.

One of my output looks like this:
Please enter your guess from 1-99: 50
Your guess is too high
Guess again: 40
Your guess is too low
Guess again: 45
Your Guess is RIGHT!!!!
